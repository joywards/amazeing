Are you still sure that every acyclic maze can be easily solved by sticking
to the left (or right) wall? Try this one!

## Running
If you have never compiled Rust before, visit [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/) to install
compiler toolchain.

You will probably also need
[SDL2 development libraries](https://github.com/Rust-SDL2/rust-sdl2#sdl20-development-libraries).

After that compiling and running Amazeing is as easy as this:
```
$ cargo run --release
```
